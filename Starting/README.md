# Starting
This guide is meant to be a step-by-step crash course to get up to speed with creating a full-stack web project. It will start off with the tools needed to get started coding, then making some simple web pages with HTML and CSS, eventually moving on to creating a backend service with Python and a frontend to interact with it. I will explain concepts along the way 

# Gathering prerequisites
Before starting to code, we need to gather the needed tools in order to be a successful developer. The recommended code editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is highly customizable and has a variety of extensions to help you with your coding.  

We will also need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), which is a version control system and will allow us to manage our code on GitHub, connecting our local code on our computers to the remote code on github.com.
