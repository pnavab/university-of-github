# Starting
This guide is meant to be a step-by-step crash course to get up to speed with creating a full-stack web project. It will start off with the tools needed to get started coding, then making some simple web pages with HTML and CSS, eventually moving on to creating a backend service with Python and a frontend to interact with it. I will explain theoretical concepts along the way as well. 

# Gathering prerequisites
Before starting to code, we need to gather the needed tools in order to be a successful developer. The recommended code editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is highly customizable and has a variety of extensions to help with coding.   

We will also need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), which is a version control system and will allow us to manage our code on GitHub, connecting our local code on our computers to the remote code on github.com. Multiple computers can be connected to the same GitHub repository, allowing multiple contributors to work on the same codebase. On Windows, restart your computer after installing Git and make sure `git` is a valid command in your terminal.
